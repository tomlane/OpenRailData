A collection of .NET core libraries for parsing open rail data from Network Rail and National Rail data feeds.

Original project based on [swlines' Cif Reader](https://github.com/swlines/CIFReader).

A continuous work in progress. This project has been more of a development playground for me than something with an end goal.
